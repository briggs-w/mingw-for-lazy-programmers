This version of MinGW is old, but it is at least already built and usable. Please see https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ for the latest version as needed. 

To get it working:
unzip it
put it in the root folder C:\
rename it MinGW
...and add these lines to the system path (This PC > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path).

c:\MinGW\bin
C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin
